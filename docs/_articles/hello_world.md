# Hello World

*{docsify-updated}*

As suggested on Twitter by Michael Arnaldi ([@MichaelArnaldi](https://twitter.com/MichaelArnaldi)), the brain behind the TypeScript effect system inspired by ZIO (see [Effect-TS/core](https://github.com/Effect-TS/core)), a blog have to begin with a "Hello World".

You can consider that this is done now.

See you soon for the first article of this blog.


With ❤️,
