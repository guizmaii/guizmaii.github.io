# Software Engineering Practices (SEPs) - Introduction

I'd like here to start a series of relatively short blog posts (quick for me to write, quick for you to read) about the software engineering practices that I like and use.

### Why / What / How

I tend to repeat the same things when I discuss and/or work with other software engineers.   
It's time for me to write and share more globally all these concepts/hacks/ideas/technics that **I consider** good practices in my work.

You'll see that I usually never invent anything.    
Most of, if not all of, the things I'll talk about are already existing concepts/ideas/technics invented by smarter people. (Thank you smart people! ❤️)      
I just want to explain them as I'm used to explaining them.

I'm not very formal in my way of explaining things.    
My goal is to explain things in a very practical manner to give you the initial intuition, so you can immediately start to use/adopt these practices.

### Disclaimer

Let's be clear **once and for all**, I never think that I'm always right nor that I'm absolutely right.   
My opinions are constantly evolving, my practices too.   
You can, for example, notice that I've never written "best practices" (except just now) in this introduction.    
All the things that I'll explain in this series are things **I consider** good practices, **today**.   
You're free to disagree as much as I'm free to disagree with you.   
If you think that I'm wrong and/or that I can improve my practices, I'm always open to respectful feedback and respectful discussions.

Also, I'm not a native English speaker, and I'll surely not always ask someone to proof-read my articles before to publish them.   
So, if you find a mistake in my text, if my text is not clear, etc., you're free to, either:
 - open a PR in the repo of this blog to propose a correction.
 - send me a feedback, via Twitter for example.     

I'm always very thankful for that because it allows me to progress.
Complaining and/or being mean about that on social media, for example, only reveals how little respect you have for other people's work.

### Next step

Now that everything is clear between us, I hope you'll enjoy what I'll share and that these blog posts will be useful to you.

With ❤️,   
Jules
